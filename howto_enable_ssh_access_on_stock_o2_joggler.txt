How to Enable SSH on a stock O2 Joggler.
========================================

This script and associated files will install, configure and enable the SSH daemon
upon boot of a base image install on an O2 Joggler updated as of 7pm 6 April 2010.

Copy these files in to the root of a fat32 formated usb stick.  Plug usb stick in to
your Joggler.  You should now be able to get root ssh access using the details below.
The ssh daemon will start between reboots as this script patches the appropriate
init.d script and comments out lines with the command "log_daemon_msg" which cause
the rcS script to die (and thus not start sshd) when attempting to start S69boot.sshd.

command: ssh letmeinssh@ip_of_joggler
user = letmeinssh
password = joggler1234

This patch is compatible with any previous telnet patches you might have applied.

This patch may take a minute or two to apply.  If it does not work reboot the joggler
with the stick removed and try again.

If you have already enabled telnet:
Once you have figured out how to change your password, and confirmed the you
can still login via ssh with the new password, it is recommended you disable
telnet the proper way which will allow you in the future to re-enable it
should ssh become broken, you would do this using the other enable telnet
file found on this site.  I have not enabled telnet in this script because it is not
neccessary when

It is advised not to run this patch multiple times.  So after patching delete the
patch files from your usb stick to prevent accidently running it again.
